A package to deal with Keplerian orbits. For a given orbit defined by the Keplerian orbital element that describe the 3 dimensional shape and orientation of an orbit (semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, argument of perihelion, longitude of ascending node) we can plot the elliptical Keplerian orbit. With an additional positional element such as true anomaly we can plot the position of the object on its orbit at that time.

Installation:

pip install git+https://github.com/jrob93/nice_orbs

ADD A TUTORIAL:

Define a simple 5 element orbit and plot the ellipse.

Convert between various orbital elements: true anomaly to mean anomaly to time etc.

Plot the position of an object at various points along its orbit.

DESIRED FEATURES:

Orbital elements from position and velocity
